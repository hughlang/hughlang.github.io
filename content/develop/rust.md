## Random Quotes

> * Although it has currently gathered attention in the JavaScript and Web communities in general, wasm makes no assumptions about its host environment. Thus, it makes sense to speculate that wasm will become a "portable executable" format that is used in a variety of contexts in the future. As of today, however, wasm is mostly related to JavaScript (JS), which comes in many flavors (including both on the Web and Node.js).

> * It wasnâ€™t always so clear, but the Rust programming language is fundamentally about empowerment: no matter what kind of code you are writing now, Rust empowers you to reach farther, to program with confidence in a wider variety of domains than you did before.  >> https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html

# Grants

* Generic Grant/Support Application Intro (TODO)
* The original ECF grant program focused primarily on non-profit infrastructure projects, and we will continue to support such important work. However, for the ecosystem to grow, we believe that community endeavors and application and tool development must also be supported at all reasonable levels. Therefore even *commercial projects *may now also apply for support from the ECF. In such a case, we would again serve as connective tissue by locating the right resources and connecting them to the vetted applicant and vetted project. Assistance could come in the form of money, mentorship, partnership, or other means. As long as the opportunity is of high quality and broadly beneficial, we will do our best to help.

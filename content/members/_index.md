# ECF Membership

The ECF is now officially open for new members to join. This offer is inclusive of all who share our vision of expanding the reach and potential of our ecosystem. Members may donate directly to the ECF by designating funds for general purpose ecosystem use, they may setup a dedicated grant program within the ECF to support specific objectives in the ecosystem, or (as indicated above), they might work with us to construct something totally new with very specialized interests.
